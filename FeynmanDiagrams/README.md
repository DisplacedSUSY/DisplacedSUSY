How to make the Feynman diagrams for this analysis:

 * I recreated the stop to lb and stop to ld diagrams from http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/EXO-19-021/index.html
except without the couplings, see
StopToBL.tex
StopToDL.tex

 * I made the other two using the SUSY package (which Jingyu used to make the stop to lb/ld diagrams), see
https://github.com/CMS-SUS-XPAG/SUSYDiagrams
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SUSYSimplifiedModelDiagrams
https://wiki.physik.uzh.ch/cms/latex:feynman
HToSSTo4L.tex
SleptonToGravitinoLepton.tex

I could only get all the feynman packages right on my mac, couldn't make it work on lxplus, didn't try on the OSU T3 or FNAL LPC.
