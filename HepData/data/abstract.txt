A search for new long-lived particles decaying to leptons is presented using proton-proton collisions produced by the CERN LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Events are selected with two leptons (an electron [e] and a muon [$\mu$], two electrons, or two muons) that both have transverse impact parameter values between 0.01 cm and 10 cm. Data used for the analysis were collected by the CMS detector in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 113 $\text{fb}^{-1}$ for the e$\mu$ and $\mu\mu$ channels and 118 $\text{fb}^{-1}$ for the ee channel. The search is designed to be sensitive to a wide range of models with nonprompt e$\mu$, ee, and $\mu\mu$ final states. The results are interpreted with models involving top squarks that decay to displaced leptons via R-parity-violating interactions, a gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model with lepton superpartners that decay to gravitinos and displaced leptons, and a model involving exotic Higgs bosons that decay to long-lived scalars, which in turn decay to displaced leptons. This is the first search at CMS for displaced leptons at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and the first search at CMS for displaced leptons in the ee and $\mu\mu$ channels that does not require the leptons to come from a common displaced vertex.
